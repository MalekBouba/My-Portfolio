# My Portfolio 
A one page Bootstrap portfolio template. It was built back on 2016 in a web design class in the university. [check it](https://malekbouba.github.io/my-portfolio/) out!

**But, don't judge,** Creating a portfolio takes some time and effort, and there is a lot to consider beyond publishing a few work samples.
In fact, I think my portfolio should be more than a simple resume, it is a showcase that proves that I can do what you talk about in your resume. 

As I said, this is built back in 2016 when I still student. Soon enough, Iâ€™ll re-build a portfolio that turns heads.
